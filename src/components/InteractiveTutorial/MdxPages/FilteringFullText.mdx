# Full Text Filtering in Qdrant

In this tutorial, we will explore how to use full-text filtering in Qdrant. The following steps demonstrate creating a collection, using full-text filters without a payload index, creating a full-text index, and performing a search on indexed fields.

## 1. Create a Collection

The first step is to create a collection in Qdrant. We define the vector size and distance metric (Cosine) for our collection.

```json withRunButton=true
PUT /collections/documentation
{
  "vectors": {
    "size": 384,
    "distance": "Cosine"
  }
}
```

Once the collection is created, you can recover it using a snapshot.

```json withRunButton=true
PUT /collections/documentation/snapshots/recover
{
  "location": "http://snapshots.qdrant.io/qdrant-web-site-docs-2024-04-05.snapshot"
}
```

You can check the total number of points in your collection:

```json withRunButton=true
POST /collections/documentation/points/count
```

## 2. Use Full-Text Filters Without the Payload Index

This example demonstrates how to use a full-text filter without having an indexed payload field.
Here, we search for points where the `text` field matches "qdrant," and return a maximum of 3 points with their payloads.

### Measure performance
Note the time that this request takes. On our machine,`"time": 0.004062916`

```json withRunButton="true"
POST /collections/documentation/points/scroll
{
  "filter": {
    "must": [
      {
        "key": "text",
        "match": {
          "text": "qdrant"
        }
      }
    ]
  },
  "limit": 3,
  "with_payload": true
}
```


## 3. Create a Full-Text Index for a Specific Field

To improve search performance, you can create a full-text index on the `text` field.

```json withRunButton="true"
PUT /collections/documentation/index
{
    "field_name": "text",
    "field_schema": {
        "type": "text",
        "tokenizer": "word",
        "min_token_len": 2,
        "max_token_len": 20,
        "lowercase": true
    }
}
```

This request creates an index for the `text` field using word tokenization. The tokenizer will split the text into words, considering only those with a length between 2 and 20 characters. All words will be converted to lowercase to ensure case-insensitive searches.

## 4. Perform Full-Text Search on an Indexed Payload Field

With the full-text index in place, you can now perform more efficient searches on the `text` field.
This example performs a full-text search on the `text` field and returns points where the text matches "qdrant," with a limit of 3 results.

### Measure performance
This time, the request came back much faster - `"time": 0.001735375`

```json withRunButton="true"
POST /collections/documentation/points/scroll
{
  "filter": {
    "must": [
      {
        "key": "text",
        "match": {
          "text": "qdrant"
        }
      }
    ]
  },
  "limit": 3,
  "with_payload": true
}
```
