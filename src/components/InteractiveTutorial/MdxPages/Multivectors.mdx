# Search with ColBERT Multivectors

In Qdrant, multivectors allow you to store and search multiple vectors for each point in your collection. Additionally, you can store payloads, which are key-value pairs containing metadata about each point. This tutorial will show you how to create a collection, insert points with multivectors and payloads, and perform a search.

## Step 1: Create a collection with multivectors

To use multivectors, you need to configure your collection to store multiple vectors per point. The collectionâ€™s configuration specifies the vector size, distance metric, and multivector settings, such as the comparator function.

Run the following request to create a collection with multivectors:

```json withRunButton=true
PUT collections/multivector_collection
{
  "vectors": {
    "size": 4,
    "distance": "Dot",
    "multivector_config": {
      "comparator": "max_sim"
    }
  }
}
```

## Step 2: Insert points with multivectors and payloads

Now that the collection is set up, you can insert points where each point contains multiple vectors and a payload. Payloads store additional metadata, such as the planet name and its type.

Run the following request to insert points with multivectors and payloads:

```json withRunButton=true
PUT collections/multivector_collection/points
{
  "points": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "vector": [
        [-0.013,  0.020, -0.007, -0.111],
        [-0.030, -0.015,  0.021,  0.072],
        [0.041,  -0.004, 0.032,  0.062]
      ],
      "payload": {
        "name": "Mars",
        "type": "terrestrial"
      }
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "vector": [
        [0.011,  -0.050,  0.007,  0.101],
        [0.031,  0.014,  -0.032,  0.012]
      ],
      "payload": {
        "name": "Jupiter",
        "type": "gas giant"
      }
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "vector": [
        [0.041,  0.034,  -0.012, -0.022],
        [0.040,  -0.095,  0.021,  0.032],
        [-0.030,  0.025,  0.011,  0.082],
        [0.021,  -0.044,  0.032, -0.032]
      ],
      "payload": {
        "name": "Venus",
        "type": "terrestrial"
      }
    },
    {
      "id": 4,
      "vector": [
        [-0.015,  0.020,  0.045,  -0.131],
        [0.041,   -0.024, -0.032,  0.072]
      ],
      "payload": {
        "name": "Neptune",
        "type": "ice giant"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Step 3: Query the collection 

To perform a search with multivectors, you can pass multiple query vectors. Qdrant will compare the query vectors against the multivectors and return the most similar results based on the comparator defined for the collection (`max_sim`). You can also request the payloads to be returned along with the search results.

Run the following request to search with multivectors and retrieve the payloads:

```json withRunButton=true
POST collections/multivector_collection/points/query
{
  "query": [
    [-0.015,  0.020,  0.045,  -0.131],
    [0.030,   -0.005, 0.001,   0.022],
    [0.041,   -0.024, -0.032,  0.072]
  ],
  "with_payload": true
}
```
