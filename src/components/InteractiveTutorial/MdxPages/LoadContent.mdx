# Load Data into a Collection from a Remote Snapshot

In this tutorial, we will guide you through loading data into a Qdrant collection from a remote snapshot. The dataset is configured to use the Cosine distance metric, and the vectors have a size of 512.

## Step 1: Create a collection

To start, you'll need to create a collection by specifying its key properties, such as the vector size and the distance metric for similarity search. In this example, we will create a collection called `midjourney`, where each vector has a size of 512, and similarity is measured using the Cosine distance.

Run the following request to create the collection:

```json withRunButton=true
PUT collections/midjourney
{
  "vectors": {
    "size": 512,
    "distance": "Cosine"
  }
}
```

Once the collection is successfully created, it will be ready to accept vector data.

## Step 2: Import data from a snapshot

With the collection in place, the next step is to import vector data. We will restore data from a remote snapshot hosted at a specific URL. This allows you to bring in pre-embedded data from a backup or previous setup.

Run the following command to initiate the data import:

```json withRunButton=true
PUT /collections/midjourney/snapshots/recover
{
  "location": "http://snapshots.qdrant.io/midlib.snapshot"
}
```

Wait a few moments while the vectors from the snapshot are added to the `midjourney` collection.

## Step 3: Verify the data upload

After the data has been imported, it's important to verify that it has been successfully uploaded. You can do this by checking the number of vectors (or points) in the collection.

Run the following request to get the vector count:

```json withRunButton=true
POST /collections/midjourney/points/count
```

The collection should contain 5,417 data points. 

### Step 4: Open the collection UI
You can also [inspect your collection](/#/collections/midjourney/) to review the uploaded data.
